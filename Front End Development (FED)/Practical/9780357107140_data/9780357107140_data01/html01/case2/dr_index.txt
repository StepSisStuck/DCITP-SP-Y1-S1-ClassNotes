What Your Support Does

Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction 
is fear and confusion. Support is just a phone call or mouse click away. Our 
free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing with 
this life-threatening illness.

By running or walking with us, you can ensure 
that we are there when people need us. Here is how your contribution can 
help:

$15 pays for a headscarf set, boosting the confidence of 
women who have lost hair from her breast cancer treatment.

$50 trains a member of our support network for a 
year to help improve the care of women with breast cancer.

$125 covers the cost of counseling sessions to help 
women cope with the distress of their cancer treatment.

$250 funds a hospital information station 
for a year so that people affected by breast cancer have easy 
access to the latest resources and help.

History

Since its inception in 2014, Diane's Run has grown from a purely local event involving
100 runners to a signature Wyoming event with more than 2000 participants annually.
The event is enormously effective in spreading the message that breast cancer need 
not be fatal if caught early enough with mammography and regular breast self-exams. 
As well as a top-flight athletic event, Diane's Run is an emotionally moving event
attracting many first timers and recreational runners. This event provides all of 
us with the opportunity to spread a hopeful message about breast cancer to our families
and our communities.


Remembering Diane

Diane's Run is named in remembrance of Diane Wheaton, mother of two and wife
of Peter, who passed away in May, 2013. Diane was an outspoken advocate of physical
fitness and healthy living. She was an inspiration to all who knew her and continues
to be an inspiration to the thousands of runners who have participated in this event.

We hope you can join us this year and become part of the Diane's Run family.
