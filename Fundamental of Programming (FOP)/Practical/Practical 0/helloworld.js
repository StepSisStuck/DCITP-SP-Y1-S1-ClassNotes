// Make sure you can see your log on the Terminal

// if you have a space, need to add "" 
// If don't have a space, don't need to add ""
// Example: File: Hello World.js = node "Hello World.js"
// Example: File: HelloWorld.js = node HelloWorld.js

//if my requirment I put double \, it will show me one \
//if my requirment I put single \, it will show me two \\

console.log("I \"love\" you");

//The I "love" you is not a valid string. Because the "love" is not a valid string. So we need to use escape sequence.

console.log("I \"Love\" you");
